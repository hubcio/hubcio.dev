I am an engineer. Engineers are lazy people.

Recently I have been having a shitload of meetings at work.
Say goodbye to good old times when you could not leave
your comfort zone for days - not talk to other people.

I've been using keyboard shortcuts to mute the microphone. Not long ago (~7 months)
I moved to a split keyboard [DIY lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58/blob/master/Pro/Doc/buildguide_en.md)
and I'm loving it, but there's a catch.
It has only 58 keys, so to mute myself I need to push the `Raise` button together with `M`,
in other words, I need to use both hands to mute myself. I could change it to another key on
the first layout, but changing the keymap layout requires recompilation of software and
flashing the keyboard itself, it's tedious. Also, I would have to re-learn this shortcut. God damn.

Around 5 years ago I was using a Microsoft Sidewinder X6 keyboard which had a volume knob.
You could map the `Mute` function to `F12` which was near it, so both volume control
and mute were close. You could use a single hand to control it. It was awesome.

Taking the above thoughts into consideration, my plan is to create a device that would mitigate these problems.
Key aspects that I would love to have:

* ability to change the volume and mute the microphone
* volume mute indicator
* microphone mute indicator
* small footprint on a desk
* long battery life - at least 2 weeks
* built-in battery rechargeable via USB-C
* wireless

I have some ideas in my mind but I need to sleep with them. Stay tuned for over-engineering.
